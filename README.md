# Cognitive Services and OCR Analytics
## Project Overview
This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) solution using Cognitive Services, integrated into a web-based user interface. The web application allows users to upload images, analyze them with OCR, and view the extracted text and OCR-related metadata, such as document type or language.

## Key Features
Upload Images: Users can upload scanned documents, receipts, or any images containing text.
OCR Analysis: The application processes the uploaded image using OCR from Cognitive Services to extract text.
Display Results: Extracted text and other relevant information are displayed in the UI.
Simple 3-Step Process: The application interface is designed to make the OCR process intuitive for non-technical users.
## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (if applicable, mention any server-side logic)
Cloud Services: Azure Cognitive Services (OCR API)
APIs: Azure Computer Vision API for Optical Character Recognition
## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Azure Account: You'll need an Azure account to use the Cognitive Services OCR API.
API Key: Set up the OCR API in the Azure portal and get your API key and endpoint.
### Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
  -     git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocr-analytics.git

Azure Cognitive Services

  -  Navigate to the Azure Portal.
  -  Create a new Cognitive Services resource.
  -  Get your API Key and Endpoint.
    
Update API Key in Code

  -   Open your project files and locate the section for the API key and endpoint.
  -  Replace the placeholders with your API Key and Endpoint from Azure.
Example (in JavaScript):

   -     const apiKey = 'YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY';
   -     const endpoint = 'YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT';

Run the Application

Open the index.html file in your browser by double-clicking it.
You will see a 3-step interface for uploading, analyzing, and viewing the OCR results.
## Usage
 - Step 1: Select Image

    -  Click the Select Image button to upload an image (e.g., a scanned document, receipt, or any text-containing image).
-  Step 2: OCR Analyze

    -  Click the OCR Analyze button to submit the selected image to the OCR engine. The image is processed using Azureâ€™s Cognitive Services API.
-  Step 3: View Output

   -  The output section displays the extracted text and any additional metadata (e.g., document type, recognized language).
## Project Structure


  * index.html          # Frontend HTML file with OCR form and UI
  * styles.css          # CSS for basic styling of the UI
  * main.js             # JavaScript for handling the OCR API integration
  * README.md           # Project documentation
## Future Improvements
Enhanced Preprocessing: Implement image enhancement techniques like noise reduction for better OCR accuracy.
Multilingual Support: Add support for recognizing text in multiple languages.
Database Integration: Store extracted data for future use in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database).
